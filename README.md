# node.js RESTful API proof of concept
The gloal is to explore node.js for building RESTful services

##Hello, World
**helloworld.js** is the fist script to check [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installation.

## Restify
The first package to evaluate is [restify](https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify). The module is in ```restify/``` folder and the initial setup is

- **restify/app.js** : application start script
- **restify/package.json** : dependency management (restify dependency specifically)
- **restify/restify.iml** : InetelliJ IDEA module file (most of JavaScript/node.js functionality is provided in the ultimate edition)

From the command line fetch the dependencies locally

    $ npm install

and then start the application

    $ node app

The application is now running at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) and can serve GET requests in JSON

- [http://localhost:8888/entity/23](http://localhost:8888/entity/23)
- [http://localhost:8888/entity/91](http://localhost:8888/entity/91)
- etc...

just echoing back the provided entity code
